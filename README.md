# Project Overview

This project consists of two main components: a backend service and a frontend application. The backend uses Node.js with Express and other libraries for handling requests, file uploads, and Excel file processing. The frontend is built with React and includes routing and styling.

## Project Structure

└── 📁Student Studio ├── 📁backend └── 📁frontend


### Backend

The backend uses Node.js with the following libraries:
- **`express`**: Web application framework.
- **`cors`**: Middleware for handling CORS.
- **`multer`**: Middleware for handling file uploads.
- **`xlsx`**: Library for processing Excel files.

### Frontend

The frontend uses React with:
- **`react-router-dom`**: For routing.
- **`tailwindcss`**: For styling.
- **`xlsx`**: Library for processing Excel files.

## Installation

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

  
    cd backend
    

2. Install the Node.js dependencies and libraries

    
    npm install
   
    npm install express cors multer xlsx


3. Start the backend server:

   node server.js
    

   The server will start and listen on the specified port. Ensure you have configured the port in `server.js`.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    
    cd ../frontend
    

2. Install the Node.js dependencies and libraries

    
    npm install
    npm install react-router-dom
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npm install xlsx


3. Start the React development server:

    
    npm start
   

   The React application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Usage

1. **Backend**: After starting the backend server, you can interact with the API endpoints defined in your `server.js` or other server files.

2. **Frontend**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view and interact with the React application.
